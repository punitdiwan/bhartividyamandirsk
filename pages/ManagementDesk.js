                                    achieving this perfection. It should help him develop his inherent qualities
                                    and all the aspects of his personality. This can be achieved when those
                                    involved in this process realize that education is much more than cramming
                                    a lot of information and passing examinations based on rote learning.

              {/* We choose to serve the society under the dynamic leadership of
              eminent people & scholars In today’s world, we need people who are
              seeker of knowledge and wisdom. Today children need to start off
              early to match steps with others in society but they need pace for
              their development. The teachers and parents face the challenge of
              teaching their children to the needs of the day. It is possible by
              learning to know; learning to do; learning to be authentic and
              learning to live together.
              
              We at Rose mary group provides the best of the modern and the
              traditional education to prepare every child to become a genuine
              world citizen. We aim to inculcate ethical and moral values in a
              child.
            
              It is my firm belief that a child’s mind is a universe full of
              possibilities. It needs the right environment to develop to its
              maximum potential at school and at home. As the saying goes, “A
              Child’s mind is like a dry sponge, ready to soak; all you need to
              do is to take it to the water.” All the students, alumni, wards
              and well-wishers are welcome to not just browse through what we
              post on this site but hope that they shall be a part of this
              pursuit, intellectually and technically, to the best of their
              knowledge. */}
